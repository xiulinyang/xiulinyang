### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Xiulin Yang.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently a PhD student in Computational Linguistics at Georgetown University.
- âš¡  Iâ€™m broadly interested in Computational Linguistics and NLP. I have worked and am working on the following areas:
  - generalization of language models (To what extend can language models generalize from their training data?)
  - inductive bias of language models and humans (What's the difference between human mind and language models? How can we make language models more human like by introducing such inductive bias?)
  - learnability of natural languages (what makes some languages harder to learn to machines?)
  - computational semantics (How to develope accurate and generalizable parsers? How can we incorporate meaning representation to downstream tasks?)
  - neuro-symbolic NLP (How to incorporate linguistic information to NLP tasks?)
  - targeted evaluation of language models (What do language models know about natural language we speak?)
